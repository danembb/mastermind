DTR:
## What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Brett: Becoming more familiar with functionality and enumerables.  Understanding gets.chomp.  Goal: get a working version of Mastermind. Stretch goal: applying other extensions to the game.
Dane: Becoming more familiar with enumerables and confident in git/github workflow. Goal: Get a working project/program (end of iteration 3) Stretch Goal: Start in on iteration 4.

## What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Brett: Open communication, empathetic feedback, Question oriented.  Looking forward to doing pair programming.  Feel like divide-conquer programming can be daunting at times.  Also understand there can be a time to work on pieces apart from each other.
Dane: Open communication, empathetic, constructive, actionable feedback. I enjoy pair programming vs divide and conquer. Having a partner to help conceptualize ideas and actively learn with is beneficial to my overall learning.

## How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Brett: Zoom and slack, messages, email for urgent issues(bhjones4545@gmail.com)
Dane: Zoom and slack calls, slack messaging when in-need of meet-up work well. (dbrophy720@gmail.com).  

## What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Brett: collaborative, work horse, fast learner, patience, good listener.  Compliment each other accomplishing goals, positive environment, understanding what each other want to accomplish.
Dane: Collaboration, patience and ability to understand various learning styles. Keeping the environment positive, helping each other be kept accountable.

## What has gone well or poorly in previous projects?
Brett:  no communication, lack of work for other members (one person does everything), no plan, unclear goals between members, waiting too long to ask for help on something they’re stuck on.
Dane: Difficulty partitioning work and making sure each team member is on the same page has been something that has gone poorly. Have experienced good teamwork in a previous project where each of us kept one another accountable for taking appropriate breaks (poms) and respecting each other’s no-code time (or if “life” happens).

## How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
Brainstorming and pseudocoding before each iteration. Collaboratively making decisions.

## How will we overcome obstacles?
Be up front about issues-- both technical and “life” issues. Working through issues together when we can (if appropriate) and defining a time when to reach out for help if needed. Taking a pom to clear our heads, if that doesn’t help-- establish a method of reaching out.

## What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Brett: quiet (get distracted pretty easily, pets are completely okay), music is fine, I tend to find resources to build off of (projects like ours to find a baseline),  video isn’t always needed besides sharing screens.     
Dane: Quiet workspace (if possible, no “active” humans). Work well with ambient music (not a necessity). A good resource could be establishing people to reach out to (mentors, instructors, other students/cohort mates). Video is optional while working together.

## What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Brett:  free all week, maybe no-code time after 9 pm.  
Dane: Tuesday 4-6:30 Wednesday (no-code) and Thursday at 7 (no-code)
In-Class Worktime: 1-1:45pm on Friday, 1-4pm on next Monday, 2-4pm on next Tuesday

## What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
Brett:  up-front,  I wont interrupt to give feedback,  respectable.  Unsure if my feedback is actually helpful.  
Dane: Actionable, respectful and with allowance to learn (if necessary). Obstinance generally holds me back from giving feedback (I don't think it’ll be the case here).

## What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team support you in improving these skills?
Brett:  comfortable with trial and error, in the past been decent at getting working classes/methods.  Consider myself comfortable and strong with git/github.  I could use more work on my knowledge(ruby methods) and more work on short cuts via keybinds.  Stopping redundancies.  The team could point out errors I make or aspects I skip when it comes to writing/testing code.
Dane: Comfortable with TDD process and basic Git/Github flow. Could be better at learning where to find answers to questions on my own (Googling and using online resources) as well as deciding when it’s time to reach out. Support may look like sensing when it’s a good time to step away and Pom or reach out.

## What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Google docs, Google jamboard, Poms, slack, zoom, git/github, atom.
Poms: 30 minute worktime / 5 minute breaktime.

## How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
Being open/collaborative about it. Bouncing ideas off each other.

## How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Brett:  runs successfully, organized code(proper indents).  Hold each other accountable to reach our common goal.  
Dane: Having a functional, running project. We can achieve this by working through iteration 3 with good code.

## How will we recognize each other’s successes and celebrate them?
Providing positivity when working through tough issues and getting code to pass.

## How can we make space for “life happening” or unexpected events coming up?
Just being understanding and maintaining open communication.
